# Headless

A simple, barebones foundation for interpreting, compiling & executing code.

</br>

## Description

The goal of the Headless project is very simple: Provide me with convinient tools to write code quickly, without any setup. I don't wanna scaffold databases, create solutions/projects, download 30 different variations of a hello-world template or install 10,000 npm packages - matter of fact, I don't even want to name the code. I just want to write something quick, run it and see what happens. If it works then I have a prototype and I can go ahead and fuck about with all that other stuff.

Headless is a group of libraries that aims to provide developers with very simple functionality. You give feed it an elegant, syntactically correct array of characters and it will analyse, compile and/or run the code. That's about it. Configuration can be set through the environment or command-line parameters. And (once I've tidied up the MVP) adding new language providers will also be quick and stright-forward.

After that you can simply find or create your preferred interface for Headless, which can feed it code and surface it's output. Or if you really want, you can code directly to Headless from your terminal - you do you.

## Getting Started

### NOTE: A LOT OF THIS WILL PROBABLY CHANGE SOON AS I TIDY UP THE MVP. AS FAR AS I SEE IT, THERE IS NO POINT IN FILLING OUT THE `Getting Started` SECTION BEFORE I DO ALL THAT

### Dependencies

* Describe any prerequisites, libraries, OS version, etc., needed before installing program.
* ex. Windows 10

### Installing

* How/where to download your program
* Any modifications needed to be made to files/folders

### Executing program

* How to run the program
* Step-by-step bullets
```
code blocks for commands
```

## Help

### NOTE: SCROLL UP ROUGHLY 20 LINES

Any advise for common problems or issues.
```
command to run if program contains helper info
```

## Version History

* 0.1
  * MVP - This is the absolute bare minimum. A few TODOs are already in the code but I have much more features & improvements planned to implement very soon

## Acknowledgments

This project (and related repos) were inspired heavily by [LinqPad](https://www.linqpad.net/) [<img src="https://github.com/pwalkerdev/Headless/assets/73733025/e4016858-7f66-4195-b127-bcecde74c3a6" width="30" height="30">](https://www.linqpad.net/). LinqPad is a fantastic tool for .NET developers and there is no substitute for it. The idea of this repo is to branch out on the idea of having a 'playground' for writing simple scripts or designing protoypes; without the usual setup/project/boilerplate/etc. But rather than having a specialised tool for C#, I intend to create a more general tool which supports multiple languages. This repo houses only the core components for managing code snippets - kinda like a back-end. With other repos to house the 'front-end(s)'
